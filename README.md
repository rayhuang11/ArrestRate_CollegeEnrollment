# RH's Senior Honors Thesis. Applied micro paper.

### Current stage

- Idea development. See issues for a running list of ideas. Progress updates are in issues as well.
- Per 8/9 meeting with Peter. Current goal: have an idea with legs by September.
- Peter's suggestion: consider starting from some datasets. Can review lit to find datasets, especially older papers.

### Storage

- Will probably store data locally, unless there is a reason to go remote.
