# RH's Senior Honors Thesis. Applied micro paper.

It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theoryâ€”if we look for confirmations. Confirmations should count only if they are the result of risky predictions... A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice. Every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or refute it. - Popper
