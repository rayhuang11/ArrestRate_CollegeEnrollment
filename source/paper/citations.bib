@article{duflo_did,
	abstract = {{Most papers that employ Differences-in-Differences estimation (DD) use many years of data and focus on serially correlated outcomes but ignore that the resulting standard errors are inconsistent. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its ``effect'' as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an ``effect'' significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a ``pre''- and ``post''-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.}},

@article{lee,
	abstract = {Background
Florida, the epicenter of the recent prescription drug epidemic in the United States, maintains a statewide drug mortality surveillance system. We evaluated yearly profiles, demographic characteristics, and correlation between drug trends to understand the factors influencing drug-induced mortality.
Methods
All drug-related deaths reported to the Florida Medical Examiners Commission during 2001--2012 were included (n=92,596). A death was considered ``drug-related'' if at least one drug was identified in the decedent. Depending on its contribution to death, a drug could be listed as a causative agent or merely present, but not both.
Results
Rate of drug-caused deaths was 8.0 per 100,000 population in 2001, increasing to 17.0 in 2010 and then decreasing to 13.9 in 2012. Benzodiazepines had the highest mortality rate in 2010, although <10% were solely due these drugs. Opioid-caused mortality rate also peaked in 2010 and started to decline (−28%) in 2010--2012. The heroin-caused mortality rates were negatively correlated with opioids and benzodiazepines (ρ's ≥ −0.670; P≤0.034). Ethanol- and cocaine-mortality rates stabilized to 3.0--3.1 and 2.8--3.0 per 100,000 over 2009--2012, respectively. Amphetamines, zolpidem, and inhalants-caused deaths were on the rise with rates of ≤0.6 per 100,000.
Conclusions
Overall declines in benzodiazepine- and opioid-caused deaths in 2011--2012 may have been related to Florida's attempts to regulate prescription drug abuse. This period, however, was also marked by a rise in heroin-caused mortality, which may reflect growing use of heroin as an alternative. Increases in amphetamines, zolpidem, and inhalants-induced mortality are an additional public health concern.},
